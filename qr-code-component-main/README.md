I couldn't create an account on Vercel and Netlify for some reason ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò´, so I just used this one.
### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS


### What I learned

If there's anything I learnt, it that I finally learnt how to use online fonts.
I always had issues with online fonts cause no matter what I did, it always didn't work,
so I would just download the fonts instead.

All I just needed to do was this:
```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

I don't actually remember what made stuck here to be honest üòÖ
It's so easy.

Also, I did this without using the Figma file, wanted to put myself to some hard training üí™

### Continued development

I want to learn more things, but the most pressing is:

- Semantic HTML
- ReactJS
- Tailwind, Vanilla or Bootstrap

I'll learn these and many more as I'm working on projects, who knows, it might be as easy as the online fonts üòÅ

### Useful resources

There are a lot of places where you can get useful information, but I prefer:
