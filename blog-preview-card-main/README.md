## My process

This section highlights the process I took towards completing the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

There are two things I learnt from this challenge:
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS media query

For the first one, it wasn't much of a challenge as it wasn't difficult in the slightest. The only problem I'd say I faced was the part where I wasn't sure if I could just go with a specific tag I wanted to use or if I was to go with the full process. Here's a sample:
```html
...
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<article>
  <section><!--Some Random Code--></section>
</article>
<aside></aside>
<footer></footer>
...
```
This was what I thought I was meant to do, but after asking in the Discord channel, I found out that I don't need to follow this long üòÇ process and I can just start where ever I please, I just needed to add a `main` tag:
```html
...
<main>
  <article>
    <section><!--Some Random Code--></section>
  </article>
</main>
...
```
As for the `media` query, this one took me a while to master this one, asked a couple of times on the net, but I eventually got the hang of it.

### Continued development

Now that I have learnt "Semantic HTML5 markup", all that's left for now are:
- Tailwind, Vanilla or Bootstrap
- ReactJS

These should be easy üòÅ

### Useful resources

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/UAfh3qzhYb) - This helped me a lot in semantic HTML5. I really liked the community, quick response, always redy to help and friendly too. Make sure you join as well, the answers might be closer than you think.
